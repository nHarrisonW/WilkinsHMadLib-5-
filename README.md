GitHub Project Part 5 - MAD LIB
This project will tell a pre mae story and ask the user for specific inputs to create a random story using a prompt.


Peer Reviewed by: Jacob Dekok

The program runs as intended, but I noticed that on line 12
there is a write line that asks for an input but there is no 
read line after so it moves on. Other than that the program 
had some pretty funny prompts.
